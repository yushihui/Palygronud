# Palygronud
This is a funny playground, paily grou nad, do whatever you can't do at work, Just do it.
## When you add A Feature, Please consider these suggestions
* Future First(new technology)
* Mobile First(web client should be mobile friendly)
* Cloud First(easy to deploy into cloud(private or public))
### at the same time it should be
1. Easy Deploying(dockerlize, k8s)
2. Easy scalization
3. Platform independent(language, framwork should be platform independant, or linux platform first; highly recommend go, java, C++, python, nodejs)
4. Easy Localization(or internationalization(user interface), we don't need to implement it right now, but we have to think about it at begining)
